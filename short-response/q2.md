# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer
We can provide a dependency array to trigger the useEffects callback to run in three ways which is:
- []: An empty dependency array will only trigger this to be called once 
- [??????]: An array with a variable in it will only trigger when that variable is changing or has changed 
- Lastly if there is no dependency array then this will trigger and is called on every state of change
