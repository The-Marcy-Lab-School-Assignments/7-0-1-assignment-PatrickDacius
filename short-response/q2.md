# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

We can provide a dependency array to trigger the useEffects callback to run in three ways which is:

- []: An empty dependency array will only trigger this to be called once
- [??????]: An array with a variable in it will only trigger when that variable is changing or has changed
- Lastly if there is no dependency array then this will trigger and is called on every state of change

Youâ€™ve identified the three key scenarios correctly, but the explanation could be clearer and more accurate. Specifically, your description of the array with a variable could benefit from an example, and the explanation of what happens when no dependency array is provided could be more precise. Make sure to mention that not providing a dependency array triggers the effect on every render.
